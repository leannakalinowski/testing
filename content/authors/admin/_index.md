Hi! I'm Leanna Kalinowski, and I'm a PhD candidate in behavioral neuroscience at the University of Toronto. I study how social neuropeptides (i.e., oxytocin, vasopressin) regulate social stress in the eusocial naked mole-rat. Outside of the lab, I'm involved in several initiatives related to science outreach, policy, and advocacy.
